# IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis-
This project uses machine learning to analyze movie reviews from IMDB. It can find hidden emotions in the reviews, like whether the reviewer liked or disliked the movie. This information can be used to understand how audiences react to movies and to improve the understanding of cinematic experiences.

## The success of this project will have a number of benefits, including:

**Improved understanding of audience perceptions**: By accurately predicting the sentiment of movie reviews, we can gain a better understanding of what audiences think about movies. This information can be used to make better decisions about what movies to make, how to market movies, and how to improve the quality of movies.

**Increased efficiency**: By automating the process of sentiment analysis, we can save time and resources. This will allow us to analyze more movie reviews and gain a better understanding of audience perceptions.

**Improved decision-making**: By having a better understanding of audience perceptions, we can make better decisions about the film industry. This includes decisions about what movies to make, how to market movies, and how to improve the quality of movies.

# Project Report: Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews

## Project Overview:

In this project, the goal was to build a machine learning model to predict whether IMDB movie reviews are positive or negative. The project involved various steps, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## Project Steps:

### 1. Import Required Libraries:

The project began by importing necessary Python libraries, including data manipulation, text preprocessing, machine learning algorithms, and evaluation metrics.

### 2. Import IMDB Movie Reviews Data:

The IMDB movie reviews dataset was imported from Kaggle, containing 50,000 reviews labeled as positive or negative sentiment.

### 3. Data Preprocessing:

* Removed HTML tags and square brackets from the text.


* Removed special characters and punctuation marks.


* Applied stemming to reduce words to their base form.


* Tokenized the text and removed stop words.


* Generated word clouds for positive and negative sentiments to visualize frequently occurring words.

### 4. Labeling Data:

Added binary labels to the sentiment column, where 'positive' was assigned a label of 1 and 'negative' a label of 0.

### 5. Train-Test Split:

Split the data into training and testing sets using an 80:20 ratio.

### 6. Feature Encoding:

Used two techniques for feature encoding: CountVectorizer with N-Gram and TF-IDF. Both techniques converted text into numerical features for model training.

### 7. Model Building:

Built classification models using various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Multinomial Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Classifier. Evaluated each model's performance on both training and test sets using metrics like accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 8. Hyperparameter Tuning:

Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance and reduce overfitting. However, some models still exhibited overfitting.

### 9. Ensemble Models:

Built ensemble models including AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Extra Trees Classifier to further enhance predictive performance.

### 10. Final Model Selection:

Chose Logistic Regression as the final model due to its consistent performance across different feature encoding techniques and its robustness to text representation variations.

### 11. Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the final model's performance on both training and test data, generating classification reports and confusion matrices. The focus was on reducing false positives to enhance precision.

### 12. Cross-Validation:

Conducted cross-validation to assess the model's generalization performance. The mean accuracy score indicated that the model performed at random chance level, suggesting the need for further optimization.

## Project Conclusion:

The sentiment analysis project successfully demonstrated the application of NLP and machine learning techniques to predict sentiment in IMDB movie reviews. The final model achieved reasonable accuracy, precision, and recall, though there is room for improvement. The project highlighted the importance of text preprocessing, feature encoding, model selection, and evaluation. Future work could involve more advanced techniques such as deep learning models and fine-tuning to enhance predictive performance further.

## Lessons Learned:

* Data preprocessing is crucial for effective NLP projects.


* Different feature encoding techniques can significantly impact model performance.


* Model selection should be based on a balance of various evaluation metrics.


* Ensemble models can improve predictive power.


* Interpretation of evaluation metrics is essential to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses.


## Recommendations:

* Explore deep learning approaches such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) or transformers.


* Implement more advanced techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction.


* Collect and use more diverse and larger datasets to improve model generalization.

## Acknowledgments:

The successful completion of this project was made possible through the combined efforts of data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. The project highlights the practical application of machine learning in the realm of sentiment analysis, providing valuable insights into the process of extracting meaning from text data.
